-> do not change the RPS_game.py file 
-> write all of the code in the RPS.py file 
-> use main.py to test the code
-> imports are what get the functions defined in on .py file over to another file for use there 
	-> e.g from name_of_file import name_of_function  

Running the tests 
-> the two players playing against each other are functions 
	-> one is random -> the other is ours
	-> we want this to learn which moves to play next
	-> based off of the move which the random one just played
	-> the random one makes a move -> and then we take what we know that was and guess which move to play next
	-> we are then running tests
		-> those are telling us whether the pass rate for the random bot was above 60%
		-> if our function was tripe the pass rate for the game would be 50% against a random bot 
		-> so our aim is for our function to learn what move to play next based off of the one which the opponent played previously 
			-> then to have the game played using our function have a pass rate of 60%, for four different tests
			-> so this tests it 
			-> if the tests were randomly ran then the pass rate would be 50% -> the aim is to have the tests ran using our function be 60%
-> you can run the tests by going into the terminal -> Python3 main.py
-> the players playing each other are functions 	
	-> the first one is random and the second one is ours (or vice versa)
	-> there is an optional log you can turn on during the game 
-> you're testing it using the Play function 
	-> the arguments are 
		-> two players to play against each other 
		-> the number of games you want it to play 
		-> a boolean which is to see the log of each game <- if the log is true you can see the messages 
	-> an example run of this function 
		-> play(player, quincy, 1000, verbose=True)
		-> player and Quincy are playing each other 1,000 times 
		-> and the log of of the test is set to on (verbose is True)
	-> this function is in the main.py file <- this is the one you run to test the code 
		-> the code which you are defining in the RPS.py file 

To submit the project
-> to submit the project, you push it to GitHub 
-> and then you load it into Replit 
-> and then you submit the URL for it to the assessment page for the first project on the course
-> if that doesn't repeat the process with a basis version and you should be fine 
-> if not then start migrating in your code and it should work
